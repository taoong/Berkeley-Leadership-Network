He serves as Vice President at Google. He is the Director of SourceTrace Systems. He's also a Co-founder and served as a President and the Chief Operating Officer at Big Network.

Niantic was founded by Mr. Hanke as an independent group within Google to explore new kinds of mobile applications at the intersection of mobile, location, social, and with eye towards an emerging class of wearable devices. The group has launched two very well received products to date - Field Trip, a guide to the hidden secrets and amazing places of the world, and Ingress, a mobile app that turns the entire world into an interactive, multiplayer game. Mr. Hanke began his business career in 1994 when he left the foreign service and moved to California to attend the MBA program at University of California, Berkeley with the dream of reconnecting with his childhood passion for techNology. While at Berkeley Mr. Hanke joined with a classmate who was founding a company to create a new kind of online computer game. The startup (Archetype Interactive) created one of the first 'massively multiplayer' Internet games. It was acquired by 3DO in 1996. The next step happened when Mr. Hanke met a group of former software executives from Silicon Graphics and Disney. Together they founded 'Keyhole' and created a new kind of map - a digital earth. Mr. Hanke led the team as CEO which launched the first ever online 3D globe based on satellite imagery and mapping data. The company agreed to be acquired by Google in 2004. The team relaunched Keyhole as ""Google Earth"" (an application that has been download by more than a billion users). Mr. Hanke eventually became the VP of the 'Geo' group at Google which launched a number of inNovative projects including scaling up Maps and Earth to cover the entire world, launching a fleet of Street View cars, creating an inNovative aerial photography platform, creating Google's own global basemap, and many more.
